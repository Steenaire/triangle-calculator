# triangle-calculator
### Written for Python 3.4

I was playing around with trigonometry and Python and decided to make a triangle calculator that then draws the triangle that you've defined (in turtle).

To make a triangle, simply use terminal (or Windows PowerShell) navigate to where you've stored draw-a-triangle.py, and type:
```
python draw-a-triangle.py
```
and press enter. Follow the instructions to select AAS, ASA, SAS, SSS, or HL to define your triangle.

After you exit the turtle window, the script will ask you if you want to make a triangle again. You can keep making triangles until you reply something other than y/yes.

This is just a thing I made for fun, and I thought maybe trig students could have fun with it.

I haven't tested this script for compatibility with Python 2.7 yet, but as I recall the main thing for this script when going from 2.7 to 3.4 involved converting everything .to_i or .to_f etc, which I don't think would hurt matters in 2.7.
