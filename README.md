# triangle-calculator
### Written for Python 3.4 and 2.7

I was playing around with trigonometry and Python and decided to make a triangle calculator that then draws the triangle that you've defined (in turtle).

To make a triangle, simply use terminal (or Windows PowerShell) navigate to where you've stored draw-a-triangle.py, and type:
```
python draw-a-triangle-34.py
```
To run the Python 3.4 version, or 
```
python draw-a-triangle-27.py
```
To run the Python 2.7 version,and press enter. Follow the instructions to select AAS, ASA, SAS, SSS, or HL to define your triangle.

After you exit the turtle window, the script will ask you if you want to make a triangle again. You can keep making triangles until you reply something other than y/yes.
